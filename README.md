<h1>Food REST API</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
The Food REST API is a Python-based RESTful API designed to manage various aspects of a service-oriented platform.
With a modular structure, this project supports features like user accounts, order management, payments, and more, while ensuring scalability and maintainability.
<br>
This project showcases best practices in backend development.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
This REST API project was designed to build foundational skills in backend development and API dedsign. It emphasizes:
<ul>
  <li>Understanding RESTful Architecture</li>
  <li>Building a Backend with FastAPI</li>
  <li>Implementing CRUD Operations</li>
  <li>Database Integration</li>
  <li>Modular design and Best Practices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature Checklist</h2>
This checklist is meant for features that are not fully imlplemented. <br>
<ul>
  <li>- [ ] Testing</li>

</ul>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
This was an extremely fun project to build. Seeing how it would interact with a live server and sending request to the API inspired me to do more.
However, I wished I applied this learning to my to my other projects to further ingrain my under understanding of FASTAPI.
